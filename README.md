# Om omkring 
## Over engineered fun with language and frameworks
This repository is a completely over engineered collection of small apps that all do the same thing - replace text in some input text.  Really - it's one line with a regex wrapped in far too much code.

### What's the point of this? 
I just would like to play around with different frameworks and programming languages. Javascript has a new framework out every week, so this project will keep me with work indefinitely. Solving the same super simple task with different tools is an easy way to learn and compare.

It also exposes a pet peeve of mine in Danish language. In the last couple of years people have stopped saying "let's talk about something" and instead started to say "let's talk around something" - or even worse "the book is around a boy and his dog". The same tendency is in English, but it has completely gone off the rails in Denmark.

### So what is it?
It is a form you can enter some text in and then all occurrences of the word "om" in the beginning of a word will be substituted with "omkring". Looks pretty stupid, but the point is to expose how stupid it is.

### Languages and frameworks
So far, this bleeding edge regular expression concept is implemented in:

* PHP
* Silex (as a webservice)
